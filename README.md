# **VIKING BATTLE !**

## **Introduction:**

Viking battle, is a luck-based game where the user can select a choice of three weapons, sword
shield or a battles axe. Each weapon has the chance to win or lose against the other weapons. For example, sword beats axe and shield beats sword. The purpose of this game is to give the user a quick and enjoyable experience in the unexpected reality off battling Vikings! The aim of the game is to defeat as many Vikings as possible without losing to many battles. But battles lost isnt considered a truly terrible thing to happen, according to mythology a Viking that lost in battle , their souls would be collected by Valkyries and taken to Valhalla where they would drink alongside of the gods!

## **Features:**

####  **Header:**
 * This contians the _**Title**_ and _**Rules**_ section. The Title shows the name of the game in bold lettering and a easy to read font. The Rules section is a button that can be pressed so the user can understand the rules of the game. The rules button also follows the same styles as the title but is more interactive with a _hover-pseudo-class_ that has a timed effect.

#### **Sub-heading:**
 * The _**Subheading**_ contains the text-content of _**"Choose Your Weapon!"**_. This text follows the same styles as the _Title_ and _Rules_ button, but it has an additional style to make it seperate from the header. This style is aimed to make the sub-heading seem like it is sticking out from the page. Providing the user with a clear differnce between the sections of the page.

#### **Weapons:**
 * The _**Weapons**_ section contains three buttons in the form of images, _**Sword:**_ ‚öîÔ∏è, _**Shield:**_ üõ°Ô∏è, _**Axe:**_ ü™ì. These buttons a the main interaction of the game, they allow the user to initiate the games function. These buttons have a similar feature to the _Rules_ button. Upon hover the button will grow in size through and then shrink when the user is not hovering anymore, the button will return to its original size after a short delay giving the buttons a smoother interactive feel for the user.

 #### **Game Section:**
 * The main eye catcher of the page. This section is made to help the user visiualise the cartooney battle between the two characters. It contains the Users character and the Computers character alongside with the the names user and computer to help the user know whos character is theirs. it also features a cool viking-looking background image where the characters a standing on.

 #### **Score:**
  * The _**Score**_ section sits beneath the _Game-section_ it tells the user the battles they have won, lost or drawn.It is shown by numbers with the score starting at 0.

 #### **Footer:** 
   * The _**Footer**_ contains the text of _**"Onwards To Valhalla!"**_ and also shares the exact same styling as the _Sub-heading_ section.

## **Technology**

 * **CSS**- I used css to give my HTML and JavaScript so styles that work onside eachother,I achieved this by adding a style.css file into my code and a link within the head of the document so that it can be accessed.
 * **HTML**- I used HTML to add the base content to my game i used it to layout the sturcture of my game so it is user freindly and interactive.
 * **JavaScript**- I used JavaScript to add interactivness, and to display messages within my Game, The way I managed this is by providing a link to the external file.
 * **Gitpod**-I used Gitpod to load all my repositories and run my coding platform.
 * **Github**- I used Github to store all my repository data and to upload my webpage to the internet.
